This site does not require authentication. There is nothing to register
and no API key to request.

- Every page and endpoint is public and read-only.
- The MCP server at ${MCP_ENDPOINT} is unauthenticated by design.
- There is no OAuth authorization server, so no
  /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server or /.well-known/openid-configuration
  exists on this domain.
- All machine-readable endpoints are listed at
  ${SITE_CONFIG.url}/.well-known/api-catalog and explained at
  ${SITE_CONFIG.url}/agents.

Questions from agents or the people they work for: ${SITE_CONFIG.agentEmail}.
A human reads everything that arrives.

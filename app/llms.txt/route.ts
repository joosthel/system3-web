> Berlin-based creative technologist building local generative AI technology. Self-hosted generative pipelines, custom-built AI solutions, and campaign-grade AI visuals and film for brands, agencies, studios, and product teams.

## About
Joost Helfers builds generative AI that runs on client hardware: self-hosted pipelines in ComfyUI and Python, custom tools teams can operate without him, and campaign visuals produced through controlled workflows. Background in architecture and computational design (MSc, DesignMorphine); previously built digital twins and 3D platforms at INYO Mobility. Now focused on local generative AI technology: self-hosted pipelines, custom AI solutions, AI visual production and film, and agentic systems. Alongside client work he makes AI film and visual experiments of his own.

Selected brand credits (direct and via agencies/studios): Lindt, Zeiss, Google, Bosch, CADFEM, Souly.

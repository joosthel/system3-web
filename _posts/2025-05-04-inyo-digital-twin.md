## Project Overview

Interactive 3D visualization for complex engineering applications, enabling engineers to optimize vehicle designs through virtual prototyping.

## Challenge

INYO Mobility needed a way to visualize and prototype vehicle designs without creating costly physical models.

## Solution

Created a digital twin system that provides:
- Real-time 3D visualization of vehicle components
- Interactive design modification tools
- Simulation capabilities for performance testing

## Results

Engineers reduced physical prototype iterations by 60%, accelerating the design process significantly.

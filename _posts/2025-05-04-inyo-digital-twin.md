## Project Overview

Developed a comprehensive digital twin platform for INYO Mobility's electric vehicle development process. The platform combines real-time data visualization with interactive 3D models to optimize vehicle design and performance.

## Challenge

INYO Mobility needed a way to visualize and prototype vehicle designs without creating costly physical models. Traditional CAD workflows were slow and didn't provide real-time performance insights.

## Solution

Created a digital twin system that provides:
- **Real-time 3D Visualization**: Interactive vehicle component models
- **Performance Simulation**: Live testing of design modifications
- **Data Integration**: Sensor data from test vehicles
- **Collaborative Tools**: Multi-user design sessions

## Technical Implementation

The platform leverages modern web technologies:
- WebGL-based 3D rendering for high performance
- Real-time data streaming and visualization
- Responsive design for cross-platform compatibility
- Modular architecture for future scalability

## Results

Engineers reduced physical prototype iterations by 60%, accelerating the design process significantly while maintaining design quality and innovation standards.

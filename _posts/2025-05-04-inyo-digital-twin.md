## Challenge

INYO Mobility needed a way to visualize and prototype vehicle designs without creating costly physical models. Traditional CAD workflows were slow and didn't provide real-time performance insights.

## Solution

Created a digital twin system that provides:
- **Real-time 3D Visualization**: Interactive vehicle component models
- **Performance Simulation**: Live testing of design modifications
- **Data Integration**: Sensor data from test vehicles
- **Collaborative Tools**: Multi-user design sessions

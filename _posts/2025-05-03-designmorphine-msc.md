## Project Overview

Project Arcadia represents the culmination of my Master's degree in Computational and Advanced Design. This project explores the intersection of parametric design, environmental responsiveness, and architectural form-finding through computational methods.

## Technical Implementation

- **Parametric Modeling**: Grasshopper for visual programming
- **Environmental Analysis**: Climate data integration for responsive behavior
- **Form Optimization**: Python scripting for performance-based design
- **Visualization**: High-quality rendering pipeline for presentation

## Key Learnings

This project taught me the importance of balancing computational complexity with design intent, and how parametric tools can be used not just for efficiency, but as a creative medium for architectural exploration.

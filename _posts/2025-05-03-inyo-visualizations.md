*Final visualization polish and presentation preparation*

### Technical Implementation
- **3D Modeling**: Created detailed vehicle models with accurate proportions and materials
- **Lighting & Rendering**: Developed lighting setups that emphasize the vehicles' premium design
- **Post-Processing**: Fine-tuned images for maximum impact across different media formats

## Results

The visualizations have been used across INYO's marketing channels, helping them secure funding and partnerships. The materials effectively communicate the innovation and quality of their electric vehicle ecosystem to investors, customers, and media.

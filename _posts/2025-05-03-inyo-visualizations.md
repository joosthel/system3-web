## Project Overview

INYO Mobility is revolutionizing urban transportation with their innovative electric vehicle ecosystem. I created a comprehensive set of 3D visualizations and marketing materials to showcase their cutting-edge technology and design philosophy.

## Key Deliverables

### 3D Product Visualizations
- High-fidelity 3D models of INYO's electric vehicles
- Photorealistic renderings for marketing campaigns
- Interactive 3D experiences for web presentations
- Technical visualization for product development

### Marketing Materials
- Digital assets for social media campaigns
- Print materials for trade shows and exhibitions
- Interactive presentations for investor meetings
- Brand-consistent visual identity across all materials

## Process & Approach

The project began with understanding INYO's vision for sustainable urban mobility. I worked closely with their design team to ensure accuracy in technical details while maintaining the sleek, futuristic aesthetic that defines their brand.

### Technical Implementation
- **3D Modeling**: Created detailed vehicle models with accurate proportions and materials
- **Lighting & Rendering**: Developed lighting setups that emphasize the vehicles' premium design
- **Post-Processing**: Fine-tuned images for maximum impact across different media formats

## Results

The visualizations have been used across INYO's marketing channels, helping them secure funding and partnerships. The materials effectively communicate the innovation and quality of their electric vehicle ecosystem to investors, customers, and media.

# system3-web — joosthelfers.com

Personal portfolio of Joost Helfers, Berlin-based creative technologist and AI artist
(AI visuals and film, generative pipelines, agentic systems).

## Stack & deployment

- Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS. Deployed to **Vercel**; pushes to
  `main` go to production, other branches get preview deployments.
- All pages are statically prerendered. The only server runtime is the public,
  read-only **MCP server** at `app/api/[transport]/route.ts` (`/api/mcp`,
  Streamable HTTP via `mcp-handler`, no auth, SSE disabled). It reads
  `lib/data.ts` and `content/blog` directly; `next.config.js` bundles the MDX
  files into that function via `outputFileTracingIncludes`.
- Build: `npm run build`. Local dev: `npm run dev`.

## Where content lives

- Projects + services: `lib/data.ts` (single source of truth — carousel, sitemap,
  JSON endpoints, and llms.txt all derive from it).
- Blog posts: `content/blog/*.mdx` (frontmatter: title, date, optional `updated`,
  excerpt, tags, optional relatedPosts).
- Site config: `lib/constants.ts`. Bump `SITE_LAST_UPDATED` when static-page copy changes.
- Design system: `app/globals.css` — five neutrals, one blue accent (#0057ff),
  Doto display + Inter body, zero border radii. Reuse existing classes before adding new ones.

## Generated endpoints — never hand-edit the output

`/llms.txt`, `/llms-full.txt`, `/feed.xml`, `/feed.json`, `/api/projects.json`,
`/api/blog.json` are build-time route handlers under `app/` (with
`export const dynamic = 'force-static'`). They regenerate from `lib/data.ts` and
`content/blog` on every build. To change them, edit the route handler or the source
data, never a file in `public/`. A route-handler path must not collide with a
`public/` file of the same name.

JSON-LD schema builders live in `lib/schema.ts`; per-page metadata helpers in
`lib/metadata.ts`.

## Agent surfaces

The site is positioned as a reference for agent-readable portfolios. The surfaces:
MCP server (`/api/mcp`), `/agents` page (human+machine guide), `/llms.txt` +
`/llms-full.txt`, `/.well-known/agent.json` (hand-maintained in `public/`),
JSON endpoints, and feeds. `llms@joosthelfers.com` (in `SITE_CONFIG.agentEmail`)
is the contact address for AI agents and automated outreach; `mail@` stays the
human channel. When projects, services, or contact details change, the MCP tools
and `agent.json` must stay consistent with `lib/data.ts` and `lib/constants.ts`.

## Voice rules for all site copy

Authentic and down to earth. Direct, modest, concrete sentences. No hype words
(transformative, cutting-edge, passionate), no em dashes, no rule-of-three flourishes,
no AI-sounding filler. Technical terms only where they are earned. When naming brand
credits, keep the honest qualifier: some work shipped via agencies that held the contract.

## Facts that are easy to get wrong

- Brand credits line (Lindt, Zeiss, Google, Bosch, CADFEM, Souly) is "direct and via
  agencies" — do not phrase as direct client relationships.
- XD Network was removed from all site copy in June 2026 (Joost is unsure about
  staying in the collective). Do not re-add it anywhere without asking him.
- Three.js is not a core skill: it was used on one project (INYO digital twin). It may
  appear as a tag on the INYO project pages only, never in bio, stack, or service copy.
- Two projects are NDA ("NDA. Process only.") — never name those clients.
